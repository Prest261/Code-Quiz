# Code-Quiz
## Description
This is a web-based application that is a quiz, consisting of six questions with multiple choice answers. This quiz contains a timer that begins as soon as the start quiz button is pressed and that will run until all questions are answered or the time runs out. If the user gets the answer correct the button flashes green and then next question appears, if the user gets the answer incorrect then the button flashes red, and 15 seconds is deducted from the timer. Once the game ends an input field is given for the user to enter their name, which will then save to local storage, along with their time. There is also a high score area for the user to look at previous scores. 

## Usage
This application is meant to be a simple quiz for users to test basic knowledge of coding with a timed quiz, that will also store their data so they can see their improvement.
